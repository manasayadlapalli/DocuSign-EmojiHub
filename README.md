# DocuSign-EmojiHub

Hey there! This cool JS app is like a detective for emojis 🕵️‍♂️. It checks out this open API right here: https://emojihub.yurace.pro/api/all.  <br/>
You can use it to hunt down emojis by their categories, do some filtering, and flip through pages like a book.

To make it work, just lone the code, and open the HTML file with your favorite browser. Easy peasy! 🚀"
